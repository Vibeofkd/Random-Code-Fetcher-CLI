# Quote Fetcher CLI

# Quote Fetcher CLI

An interactive **Node.js Command-Line Interface (CLI)** project built during my internship to practice:
- Node.js event loop
- Non-blocking I/O (`fs` module)
- Basic scripting
- CLI interaction with `readline`
- JSON file storage
- Module exports and imports

This project demonstrates Week 2 of my Node.js learning journey.
